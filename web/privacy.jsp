                    <h6>Personally Identifiable Information and other Information</h6>
                    <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means any information by which someone can be personally identified,
                        including name, address, telephone number, email address, and other information incidental to providing goods or services (also referred to 
                        herein as “personal information”). We collect personally identifiable information from you only when you voluntarily provide us with this 
                        information, such as when placing an order on the Site, establishing an account, contacting us with a question or comment, utilizing an "Email
                        to a Friend" feature, or signing up to receive emails about our latest products and services</p>
                    <p>When you visit the Site, our web servers may automatically recognize certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your 
                        domain name, access provider, IP address, and browser language. The Site also uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique 
                        identification to your computer. The information collected from cookies allows us to provide better customer service to you and to improve features
                        of our Site in a variety of ways, including by determining whether you have visited the Site in the past and which pages of our Site you have visited</p>
                    <p>If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your information being used in this way, most computer systems and web browsers offer privacy settings and
                        options, such as disabling cookies or opting for “Do Not Track” features. We do not override these settings or options. However, in order to access
                        certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Site, you may be required to provide us with certain information, including some 
                        types of personally identifying information. If you do not wish to provide such information through the Site or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned
                        privacy features of your computer system or web browser, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the
                        Site</p>
                    <h6>Security Precautions</h6>
                    <p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us and Shoppiana is committed to handling such information carefully. 
                        We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your personally identifiable information. We use secure socket layer technology
                        to protect the security of your payment information and we encrypt your personally identifiable information when it is sent over the Internet. 
                        No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially 
                        acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                    <p>The Site may also contain links to third party websites, for the convenience of users in locating information, products, or services that may be of interest.
                        If you access a third party website from a link on this Site, any information you disclose on that website is not subject to this Privacy Policy. It is 
                        possible that these links may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy 
                        practices of such websites, advertisers, or third parties or the content of such websites and it is your sole obligation to review and understand the privacy
                        practices and policies of these other websites. We do not control the use of cookies or the collection of information by these third parties, nor how they
                        manage such information. It is solely your obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites, advertisers, and 
                        any third parties.</p>

                    <h6>What Information Can I Access?</h6>
                    <p> We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you have established an account on the Site or signed up to receive electronic newsletters
                        or promotional emails from Shoppiana, including new ideas, special offers, and event information, or to otherwise receive communications about our products and
                        services, you will have the right at any time to opt out of receiving marketing emails or to specify which, if any, communications you would like to receive from us</p>
                    <p> If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing via email, click the unsubscribe link on the footer of marketing emails. Shoppiana will continue to send you 
                        non-promotional, service emails concerning your account, such as emails relating to available upgrades, billing and payment information, outstanding balance on 
                        your account, and other emails relating to your account and/or your use of the Site.</p>
                    <h6>Policy updates</h6>
                    <p> We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. You should check this page periodically for changes. Your 
                        continued use of this Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to those changes. In the unlikely event that
                        we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.</p>
